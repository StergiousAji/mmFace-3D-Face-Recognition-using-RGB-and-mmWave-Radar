# mmFace: 3D Face Recognition using RGB and Millimetre Wave Radar

Secure and compact face recognition systems often rely on expensive, non-commercial hardware that must be tailor-made for specific needs. Current systems typically employ near-infrared waves to capture dense 3D maps of human faces due to their high precision. However, this approach has its limitations, since they can be blocked by thin materials such as spectacles and facial hair. With the recent success of low-power millimetre wave radar sensors for hand gesture recognition, we investigate their potential for more resilient 3D face recognition. We propose **mmFace**, a hybrid end-to-end system that harnesses both RGB and mmWave signatures to accurately recognise facial identities and verify their authenticity, effectively countering 2D spoofing attacks.
